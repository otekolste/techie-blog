# Techie Blog!

## Description

Welcome to the Techie Blog! This platform allows users to connect with other developers by creating accounts, creating posts, and commenting on others' posts; users can also edit and delete their existing posts. This project was built using TailwindCSS, Sequelize, Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and was the result of my practicing full-stack development, combining frontend and backend development to create a functioning application!

## Usage

Go [here]() to check it out!

When you open the site, you should see the homepage as follows. To do anything on this site other than view the front page, you need to create an account. You can click "login" or any of the links and you will be redirected to the homepage.

Assuming that you don't have an account, you can click the "create account" button to be redirected to the signup form. Enter a username and password.

The site will automatically sign you in with those credentials. Now that you have access to the site, you can comment on others' posts and create your own! Click on a post to be redirected to that page.
