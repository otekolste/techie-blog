# Techie Blog!

## Description

Welcome to the Techie Blog! This platform allows users to connect with other developers by creating accounts, creating posts, and commenting on others' posts; users can also edit and delete their existing posts. This project was built using TailwindCSS, Sequelize, Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and was the result of my practicing full-stack development, combining frontend and backend development to create a functioning application!
